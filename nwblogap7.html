and sensitive matter, therefore he ascertained that it is
a right time for us to get serious and make a decision
to preserve our art, because as we all know indigenous
art is in caveat and we should develop avenues to
preserve it, but how in itself is a question? Importantly
it is necessary to balance the gap between indigenous
and modern art forms. Thus we should now all focus in
solidarity to work together with the help of technology
and ideas, pool our experiences and explore disparate
techniques to preserve our art, our legacy and culture
widely in years to come. ISCS that has been addressing

existing lacuna in the policy and pragmatics are the
vital reasons why with passing days varied forms of
crafts, goods and products refrain from finding a place
for themselves in the shelves and wardrobes of the new
generations. Each of the speakers did highlight the fact
that the pandemic situation had taken an immense toll
on the handicraft sector as well, but at the same time
has opened up digital corridors for its acknowledgement
and procurement. Thus digital platforms should be used
widely during by the sectors and its stakeholders while
convalescing from the pandemic crisis. Mr. Gianluca
Rubagotti– who expressed that in a Country like Italy
a lot of emphasis is laid down on the beauty and art
and culture the middle age renaissance had played
an important role in bringing forward evolving and
connecting regions through art and culture immensely.
In case of handicrafts of West Bengal he said that crafts
of this region has been explicitly appealing, and the
craft itself is a good source of livelihood, economic up
streaming for the state itself. The pandemic has resulted
in trepidations for the handicraft sector challenging the
lives of its creators. But at the same time it has taught
us to regulate things technically, including promoting
and selling goods across regions. It’s time for all of
us to actually unite and think about the growth of
the sector in post pandemic times. He elucidated the
example of multiple world renown fairs taking place
at Milan, which often exhibits exquisite products and
art crafts, also been attended by people from multiple
sectors across the globe. India should take initiative to
maximize the participation of artisans in those fairs and
in the same way should acquaint the audiences about
the products and legacy compounding the products with a larger audience. It will be our pleasure to assist
the regions in encouraging their participation in fairs
and art festivals taking place in Italy and also in parts of
Europe altogether.
The first session also elicited discussions amongst the
audience and Distinguished Speakers about the craft

listing important forms of crafts district wise and
acknowledging the inspirations of eminent people like
Kamala Devi Chattopadhyay and her contemporaries

propagating the sector as a lucrative ones from the rural

Ms.Sarma stressed that soft skills training programmes

be imparted through workshops amongst artisans to
synchronize high price, a high supply and high demand
in proportional with each other.<br>
Prof. Kumar further added that the Indian handicrafts
could be broadly divided into three categories: folk crafts,
religious crafts and commercial crafts. Popular folk crafts
that are modified according to the demands of the market
become commercial crafts. Myriads of handicrafts are
made for the diverse rites and rituals associated with

and technological interventions can help the handicraft
industry reach a place in the international market, a
place that is rightfully deserved. The Incredible India

as the cultural diversity of the country, as they embody
our heritage of creativity, aesthetics and craftsmanship.  </b></p>

highly decentralized activity the handicraft industry is
a shining example of linkage and cultural diversity. We

have failed to crack into the international market.
Taking the discussion further the proceeding Speaker
Ms. Kanaklata Datta, who has been a renowned designer
working with eminent Directors like Rituporno Ghosh
and branding men’s fashion, said that Indian traditional
fashion has always been a subject of a revolution unlike
western wears which is so quickly adopted. Our own
Indian motifs and history on weaves and textiles received
slow acceptance in the country itself. Participating in
International fashion weeks and festivals has been much
more appealing as Indian art, history and intellectuality
has been a faster subject of admiration and adulation.
Ms. Kanaklata believes that the new generation is again
showing interest to revive tradition and hence appealed
to make right use of technology and digital mediums

a big challenge but also a wider platform to acquaint
the global visitors coming during Durga Puja and other
festivals with the flavours of beautiful crafts made
from simple day to day products. Though Durga Puja
is a religious festival but these designs and decorations
develop on basis of different contemporary themes.
Artists install artworks combining several art forms
such as sculpture, digital art, woodblock prints canvas
etc. Different groups of folk artists and traditional
craftsmen join hands with the contemporary sculptures
and Art College graduates to install gigantic creative
spaces. Nowadays in Kolkata Durga Puja is not a mere
religious festival but an art carnival in its true sense. Folk
art of Bengal has and will find its way of development
