Xuan Phuc. She explained the significance of the virtual
summit and its impact over the growing bilateral
relations. Mentioning the issue of the global pandemic
that had engulfed the entire world she highlighted how
it had adversely affected the Indo-Vietnamese bilateral
relationship. However she added that at present both
the countries were collaborating with each other to fight against the growing impact of Covid-19. She also hoped
that like past both the countries would emerge stronger
after such adversity.</b></p>
<img src="assets/img/j15.jpg" alt="Nature" width= "100%" >
					   <p class="excert"><b>Her deliberation thereafter focused on the military
and strategic cooperation between the two countries.
In her discourse she opined that such cooperation had
contributed largely in establishing peace and security in
the Indo-Pacific region. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>In the due course of her deliberation she highlighted
the potentiality of the bilateral trade and economic
relations between India and Vietnam which had recently
surpassed 10 billion U.S. dollars. She also identified areas
like exploration of hydrocarbon sources, renewable
energy, agriculture, agro- processing, Information
and Technology, Telecom, Automobiles, Textiles and
Pharmaceuticals where both the countries could enhance
their trade and cooperation initiatives. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>She concluded her introductory note by saying that
while both the countries were celebrating their 5th year
of comprehensive strategic partnership and 50th year of
diplomatic relationship, it was necessary that both the
countries would work more closely both in regional and
international forums. She thereafter requested Mr. Do
Thanh Hai to initiate his presentation.</b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> Mr. Do Thanh Hai’s presentation focused on the
development of the bilateral relationship between
India and Vietnam and the possible way forward of
this relation. The distinguished speaker initiated his
presentation by highlighting the deep civilizational
and cultural linkages both the countries shared since
the ancient times, specially mentioning the kingdom of
Champa in Vietnam which drew its cultural inspiration
from India. He said that this linkage remained through
ages and in the modern era the same had grown even
stronger. In his deliberation he pointed out how India
had been supportive towards Vietnam’s struggle for Independence and Vietnam’s initiative to resolve
the Cambodian crisis. He opined that the bilateral
relationship between the two countries is based on a
strong foundation and pointed out that both the countries
had upgraded their relationship into a comprehensive
strategic partnership. He said that though bilateral
relationship had received a major setback due to the
outbreak of the global pandemic yet both the countries
shared a strong economic and investment relationship.
In the due course of his discussion he also emphasized
on the development of tourism and people to people
contact between both the countries in the post pandemic
scenario.</b></p>
<img src="assets/img/j16.jpg" alt="Nature" width= "100%" >
					   <p class="excert"><b>The distinguished speaker thereafter focused his
discourse on the future of the bilateral relationship
and mentioned the recent joint vision document signed
by the leadership of both the countries, where it was
decided that both the countries would cooperate
with each other in the field of defence, trade, science,
technology and energy. He also opined the necessity
of increasing people to people contact that could help
the people of both nations understand the civilizational
linkages between both the countries. He concluded his
deliberation by stating that people of both the countries
had very little knowledge about each other and opined
that a strong institutional mechanism is needed in this
regard. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>The next speaker Ambassador Pranay Verma focused his
discourse on connectivity which he termed as one of the
significant aspects of the bilateral relations. He opined
that historically both the countries were well connected
and also added that the necessity to take a holistic view
on connectivity which incorporated digital, economic,
cultural, social and institutional connectivity.</b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>In his deliberation he spoke on the political connectivity
between both the countries which gradually boosted
through regular exchanges of phone calls between the
Prime Ministers of the respective countries, institutional
dialogue between the foreign ministers and defence
ministers of both the nations. He opined that the joint
vision that was published after the virtual summit of
21st December, 2020, rather than a joint statement
showed the eagerness of both the nations to establish a
robust bilateral relation. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> He thereafter focused his discussion on the defence
cooperation between India and Vietnam where he
highlighted various initiatives taken by both the nations
to strengthen their defence cooperation. On the issue of economic and trade relationship he
pointed out how Covid-19 forced both the countries

						<img src="assets/img/j17.jpg" alt="Nature" width= "100%" >

					   <p class="excert"><b> Ambassador Verma during his discourse also touched
the issue of cultural cooperation and showed how both
the countries were cooperating in the conservation of
the shared heritage.</b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>In his presentation he also laid importance over the
societal connection between both the countries through
a growing Indian diaspora in Vietnam and people to
people contact especially through the youths of both the
countries. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> The last part of his deliberation focused on the issue of
digital connectivity where he analysed the importance
of initiatives like e-certificate, virtual business etc.
He commented that the digital connectivity was a
fundamental pillar of an effective bilateral relation.
He concluded his presentation by stating that as India-
Vietnam was celebrating the 5th year of Comprehensive
Strategic partnership and fifty years of diplomatic
relation, both the nations must lay emphasis over
the above stated issues to build a strong and effective
bilateral relationship.</b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>The subsequent speaker of the webinar, Dr. Ton
Sinh Thanh focused his discussion on the physical
connectivity between India and Vietnam. According to
the speaker North East India, located at an equidistance
between Indian capital Delhi and Vietnam capital Ho
Chi Minh city could emerge as a significant player in
developing India-Vietnam physical connectivity. In his
discourse he mentioned that the commencement of the
direct flight between India and Vietnam had contributed
significantly in the development of physical connectivity
between the two nations. He also mentioned that in recent past sea connectivity between India and Vietnam
had improved significantly leading to a more close
maritime connectivity between the two nations. He also
emphasised the development of land connectivity and
hoped for an extension of the trilateral Asian Highway
between India-Myanmar-Thailand up to Vietnam.
He also mentioned the possibility of rail connectivity
between the two nations in the coming future. He
mentioned the importance of digital connectivity which
according to him had increased significantly during the
pandemic days. </b></p>
<img src="assets/img/j18.jpg" alt="Nature" width= "100%" >
					   <p class="excert"><b>He concluded by mentioning that though favourable
conditions remained there for the further development
of bilateral relationship between the two countries,
yet delay in the implementation of the projects and
bureaucratic hurdles remained the major obstacles for
a further developed bilateral relation between India and
Vietnam in the future. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>The last speaker of the webinar Mr. Alok Bansal
initiated his discourse by highlighting the 2000 years
old civilizational linkages between India and Vietnam.
He also opined that though often people thought India-
Vietnam relation through the prism of Buddhism,
however according to the distinguished speaker there
also remained a huge link of Hinduism between the two
nations. He added that the temple complex of the Cham
kingdom revealed how Hinduism linked India with
Vietnam. In his presentation the distinguished speaker
stated that even before Vietnam became independent,
it had been in regular communication with India and
the first Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru had
established close relation with the revolutionary leader
of Vietnam Ho-Chi Minh. He also analysed how the
two countries over few decades had developed their
relationships which led India to be the fourth country
in the world with whom Vietnam had a comprehensive
strategic partnership. The eminent speaker, in his </b></p>
<img src="assets/img/j19.jpg" alt="Nature" width= "100%" >
					   <p class="excert"><b>presentation, also highlighted the decade old defence
collaboration between the two countries and how it had
progressed and achieved a new height. He emphasised
the necessity of an overland connectivity and pointed
out the significance of extending the Asian trilateral
highway up to Vietnam. He also pointed out that the
commencement of direct flight between India and
Vietnam would help both the countries. He opined that
due to the operation of direct flight tourist inflows from
India to Vietnam had increased and in future tourist
outflows from Vietnam to India would also increase,
resulting in a possibility of more direct people to people
contact. He also emphasised the role of the youth in
developing people to people contact. The distinguished
speaker also addressed the issue of Maritime trade
between India and Vietnam and analysed how both the
countries were working together to establish the notion
of freedom of navigation even in the contested areas
of South China Sea. He concluded his presentation
pointing out how both the countries were working
together in the Indo-Pacific region on blue economy,
maritime security and maritime connectivity. </b></p>

					   <p class="excert"><b>After the deliberation of the distinguished speakers,
the moderator of the webinar opened the session for
questions and comments from the audience. A number
of important questions were raised and were adequately
replied by the speakers. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> The question and answer session was followed by a vote
of thanks which was delivered by Arindam Mukherjee,
Director, Institute of Social and Cultural Studies, India,
who on behalf of the organisers thanked the Moderator,
