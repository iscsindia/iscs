that as a part of its imperatives engages itself to identify
and deliberate on concurrent happenings and multiple
policy approaches.In support of Gail India, hosted a
Hybrid Seminar on “Post Pandemic Opportunities for
India’s Energy Security and Mobility Sector”. As an
initiative to try and highlight factors that makes energy
–security as a concept extremely complex. Secondly
posts challenges towards establishing effective energy
supply and security regime. Lastly over discussion with
Distinguished Speakers and eminent academicians
and researchers tried to address the quest for securing
energy supplies collaging foreign security policies
for the country to ensure a cantabile energy security
frameworks post pandemic times.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> The Hybrid seminar was marked with the inaugural
address of Sri. Arindam Mukherjee, Director,ISCS, India
.Who acknowledged that energy –security is a significant
subject of academic deliberations and recognized as a
corner stone of bilateral regional and global economic
affairs of every nation. He stressed on the fact that
energy –security issues plays a strategic roles in ensuring country’s economic, development, prosperity, stability
and well being of the people. India is one of the largest
growing economies that has witnessed a gradual rise
in consumption of energy .Today India is fifth largest
consumer of energy and by 2030it is expected to
become the third largest consumer overtaking Japan
and Russia. However at present COVID-19 as a non
traditional security threats has emerged as a concern for
Indian energy security like all other economic sector the
cascading effect of pandemic are been felt in the India’s
energy sector. Thus driven by the necessity the organized
hybrid seminar and the discussion would be a solid
paradigm to discuss agendas like building of efficient
energy storage system, Innovative energy technology,
green start ups, green investments etc of the future.  </b></p>

Chair - Vice Admiral Shekhar Sinha, who stated that
energy is the core factor that has and continues to lead
a conflict prone situations impeding life of the people
and harmony among the neighbouring countries. He
said that 45% of India’s energy resource is secured
from coal, crude petroleum is 35%, natural gas is only
7%. Thus stress should be laid on procuring energy  </b></p>

is also important for the growth and development of
manufacturing units that is directly proportional to the
development of the nation. Thus security angles of the
energy through policy approach should be emphasized
,though Maritime security is rested with incumbent to
protect the energy resources of the country but a more
comprehensive policy formats should be developed,
NITI Ayog reports have mentioned about certain target
based approach on which importance should be given.
Where as Ms. Swati Ganeshan- focussed on areas like
impact of climate change on energy factor and ways to
approach them in future, options and opportunities in
the energy sector, and attempt to redefine energy security
aspects and its future goals sustainably. Ms.Ganeshan
added that rightfully and skilfully utilization of energy
should be the priority along with usage of technology
as the usage of fossil fuel cannot be brought down but
could be replaced with technology, more of dialogues
and symposiums should be initiated with other
countries to resolve energy-security oriented disputes
and also in finding alternatives to reduce dependency
on other countries for acquiring energy in future.
Alternatives should be identified and used to reduce
carbon emission through infrastructure, manufacturing
units, transport sector. According to Ms.Ganeshan
India comparatively have been able to catapult a very
vibrant and implementation policy approaches so far
to gather capital through co-operations and bilateral
relations. But in future should lay greater importance to
gather much more renewable energy resources, devise
policies to improve geo-political issues, increase usage
of technologies and make a significant achievements in
G20 goals. Sri Pratim Ranjan Bose shred his views on the persistent arguments coal or nuclear and rested much
weight on the utility of nuclear power. His deliberations
over examples of incidences and happenings of country’s
at various times laid impetus on building collaborations
to resolve geopolitics, invite investments in the energysecurity
sector to boost the manufacturing units and
stimulate the economy of the country.  </b></p>

focus remained on elucidating factors like availability,
affordability and accessibility in case of energy-security.
He added that though much voices have been raised in
regards of subsidy of cooking gas but pint here is to
acknowledged how fast the energy resources have been
reaching the household especially the rural households
of the nation. While the Distinguished Speaker of the
session Dr. Anindya Bhattacharya- regarded that in case
of energy supply and demand goes hand in hand , we
can only ensure that the country has a secured energy
resource when the cycle of availability , accessibility and
affordability is streamlined. On the other hand policies
and lacuna in import regulatory policies, trading and
usage of advanced technology should be mend to ensure
sufficiency of energy and satisfactory energy security in
coming times. Like others the speaker emphasised on
more dependability of renewable source of energy like
solar, but underlined that in case of Solar , popper storage
capacity is important thus importance should be laid
on developing efficient storage capacity. According to
Dr. Bhattacharya to conserve and make energy resource
available and affordable to all Government should focus
on factors associated with trade, consumer-producer
prospective, rural demands, storage facility to overcome
climate change and calamities, wealth management and
multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral engagements.   </b></p>
