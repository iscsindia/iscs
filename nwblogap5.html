India’s Concerns

                       <p class="excert"><b> Much has transpired in Myanmar since 1 February,
2021 when the tatmadaw (military) replaced the
democratically elected President Win Myint, with an
acting President, U Myint Swe. The latter transferred all
powers to the military, under the leadership of General
Min Aung Hlaing. Thereafter, Aung Sung Suu Kyi, along
with most of the National League for Democracy (NLD)
officials and other opponents of the tatmadaw were
detained and a year long state emergency was declared,
right before parliament was to convene for the first time
since general election was held on 8 November, 2020.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> More than a month over this watershed event, violence
and chaos have spread in many parts of the country.
While international condemnation and sanctions against
the tatmadaw have poured in from various corners of
the globe, including USA, New Zealand and others,
India is trying to find a balance between its foreign
policy ideals and geopolitical realities in addressing the
challenge in its eastern neighbourhood. India’s position
is going to be particularly defining for future of New
Delhi’s development projects in Myanmar as well as the
now dormant insurgent problem in its north east region
(NER).   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Tatmadaw’s junta avatar  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Since its independence in 1948, Myanmar has seen
the tatmadaw play the role of a junta for most parts
of its history. In 1962, General Ne Win toppled the
democratically elected government of Prime Minister U
Nu, paving the way for a ‘Burmese way to Socialism’
that lasted, with a one-party rule of the Burma Socialist
Programme Party (BSPP), for the next 26 years.
Characterized by what is termed as ‘negative neutralism’
in foreign policy, Myanmar remained a rather closed
country during this period, barring its interactions with
China from the late 1970s. India on the other hand,
though had gained out of the camaraderie between U
Nu and Jawaharlal Nehru during the 1950s, was only
left wanting to engage with Burma (the name used until
1988) at the time.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> As discontent with the Ne Win regime grew, the
tatmadaw once again usurped political power through
a coup, following the nationwide 8.8.88 uprising that
turned immensely bloody. This time, the tatmadaw
was represented by the newly formed State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC, replacing the
BSPP) led by General Than Shwe. The new avatar failed
to find democratic support of the populace through
the multi-party election in 1990. A transfer of power
was disallowed. Instead, Suu Kyi, who emerged as the
face of democracy in the country after the resounding
success of the NLD, was put under house arrest. India
vociferously threw its weight with the pro-democracy
calls of the international community, many of whom
imposed heavy sanctions on Myanmar and cornered it
as a pariah state. As the popularity of Suu Kyi grew
throughout the decade, so did the demand for democracy.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  To remain legitimate and relevant, the junta took certain
steps which were meant to signal a positive change. For
one, the SLORC was dissolved and another avatar,
the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) was
launched in 1997 as the tatmadaw’s political face. But as
the saying goes, expressed an article in The Irrawady that
year, “no matter how many times a snake sloughs off its
skin, it is still the same (poisonous)” . The successor of
the SPDC, the Union Solidarity and Development Party
(USDP) launched in 2010 should therefore be seen as no
more than old wine in new bottle.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Tatmadaw’s democratic insecurities  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  The tatmadaw has had an ambivalent notion of
democracy as a tool of legitimacy, but one that is
expected to produce only favourable results for itself.
Hence, a democracy that is vibrant and different from
what the tatmadaw envisioned has often bread insecurity
for them, the most obvious being the insecurity of losing
power. To avoid this, and to live up to General Khin
Nyunt’s ‘seven-step-roadmap to democracy’ promised
in 2003, the tatmadaw crafted its own political set up
through a new Constitution in 2008.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  The 2010 general election held as per the new rules
worked well for the tatmadaw because the NLD
boycotted it. In fact, President Thein Sein, seem to go
beyond the tatmadaw script and usher in some changes
that looked refreshing. However, as the first democratic
transfer of power took place after the 2015 general
election, ironically, the generals complained of being
‘bullied’ in parliament . Then, after the 2020 election
results were declared, the UPSD called it fraudulent and
refused to accept it. When the tatmadaw’s protest was
allegedly not addressed satisfactorily, it marched across
the capital, Nawpitaw, took over the political reigns of
the country forcibly and trampled over democracy, a
little more with each passing day.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Constitutional armour  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Among other things, the 2008 constitution, the third
of the country from the time of independence (earlier
being 1947 and 1974), was meant to ensure continued
power for the military through three routes. Firstly,
Chapter 3, Article 59(f) is indirectly targeted at Suu Kyi,
to bar her from becoming President, the top office of the
country (since the designation of Prime Minister was
removed). Yet, the new post of State Councellor created
for her did not stop her from being the de facto leader
since 2015. The Rohingya conundrum and her lack of
voice to protect their plight did tarnish her image, albeit
only internationally. At the national level, she remained
the hope for democracy, as recent events have revealed.
It is not surprising that on 1 March, 2021, two new
criminal charges have been added to the obscure list
issued against her, ever since the election campaign last
year.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>   Secondly, Article 417 states that if there is ‘sufficient
reason’, especially any act that can ‘disintegrate the
Union or disintegrate national solidarity’ or lead to
‘loss of sovereignty’, emergency can be declared in
the country. This is what was invoked in the coup this
February. Interestingly, in contrast to the tatmadaw’s
claim of lack of national solidarity, in a rare show of
unity in decades, 10 of the ethnic armed groups have
now joined the biggest Civil Disobedience Movement
(CDM) ongoing in Myanmar, to resist the authoritarian
regime.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> Thirdly, while 25% of the seats in the parliament is
reserved for the tatmadaw (Chapter 4, Article 109b,
Article 141), the National Defence and Security
Council (NDSC) stands above the parliament in case of
emergency, as it ‘exercises sovereign power in the name
of the President’ (Chapter 11, Article 431). General
Hlaing, who heads it as the Commander-in-Chief, will be
difficult to remove, despite his retirement due this July.
If these were not testimony enough of the tatmadaw’s
insecurities, the clause stating that 75% parliamentary
votes are needed to change the constitution is a clear
evidence of the armour made to protect the interests of
increasingly notorious institution.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  India’s concerns  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> ‘Everything will be OK’, read the T-shirt of the 19-yearold
girl, shot in the head, whose protest and death
has become a symbol of defiance in Myanmar. By 4
February, at least 40 people were killed as the military
used live ammunition, among other means, to quell the protests across various states. While Ambassador of
Myanmar to the UN, Kyaw Moe Tun, openly appealed
to the international community to resist the tatmadaw,
the latter allegedly dismissed him of responsibility.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Despite democracy now being openly discarded
in Myanmar, unlike its clear stand in 1988, New
Delhi has been measured in its approach. Simply
speaking, two main reasons explain this. One, India
has an economically and strategically more intricate
relationship with Myanmar today. The Look East Policy
of 1991 (upgraded into the Act East Policy in 2014) has
led New Delhi to engage with Nawpitaw through bilateral
initiatives, as the Kaladan Multimodal Transit
Transport Project (KMTTP), or multi-lateral ones, such
as the Tri-lateral highway project. These projects worth
USD 650 million, clubbed with development assistance
worth USD 1.75 billion make it difficult to prioritize
idealism over utilitarianism. The impact of this coup
upon India’s development project therefore remains one
of New Delhi’s gravest concerns at the moment.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> Secondly, India has engaged with the military regime
in the last decade, with a view to counter China
from overwhelmingly edging ahead in this crucial
neighbourhood. When General Min Aung Hlaing visited
India in August 2012, he was allowed to invite upon
the then Indian President beyond convention and what
protocol permitted. More recently in October 2020, the
visit by Indian Foreign Secretary and Chief of Army Staff
to Myanmar reflected the enhanced engagement with
the military. These developments should also be read
in the backdrop of the insurgent problem India faces in
its NER, which has reportedly seen 70% reduction in
insurgency incidents by 2020 compared to 2013. India,
therefore, now needs to urgently find a balance between
the civil-military tug in Myanmar, least it throws the
baby out with the water, that indeed is muddied already.   </b></p>
