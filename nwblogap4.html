Avoid Accidental War

                       <p class="excert"><b>   Introduction </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Negotiations can be favourably concluded when there
are leverages to bargain. When China insisted sector
by sector disengagement, it was clear that China want
India to give up tactically advantageous positions along
the south bank of PangongTso especially Kailash Range
that was occupied by the Indian Army in a swift move.
China disengaged and retreated from North and South
Bank of PangongTso because occupation of Kailash
Range was a leverage with India. It may be premature to
suggest that China may not disengage from Hot Spring,
Gogra, Depsang and Demchowk, but the indications so
far suggest that China may retain some of the critical
areas as leverage with them including Depsang and few
more areas. It may be difficult for India to compel China
to retreat to pre-April 2020 positions in all areas in the
absence of any worthwhile leverage. Major General
Ashok Mehta says, “Clearly, the Chinese have brushed
aside the demand for the restoration of status quo ante.
In fact the Chinese have never used the terminology of
restoring status quo ante, but instead used restoring
peace and tranquillity in border areas.” Though neither
the government nor the Army has stated that China has
declined to discuss withdrawal of forces from other areas
of ingress, but in the absence of any leverage it will be
Dreamstime
difficult to compel PLA to retreat and maintain status
quo ante along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh. If India gives
in Eastern Ladakh, China will attempt similar salami
slicing in other sectors as well. During Sumdorong Chu
and Doklam standoff China had realised that modern
day Indian Army cannot be pushed back by force and
there will be strong reaction. Thus standing firm is the
need of the hour.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Where is the LAC?  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  General HS Panag the former Army Commander,
Northern Command is of the view that China has
already reached 1959 claim line in Eastern Ladakh
and any disengagement that may take place will be
though “good for the long term peace” but in ultimate
analysis it may lead to creation of buffer zone that may
be entirely encompassing within India’s claim line. This
raises one pertinent question, where is the Line of Actual
Control (LAC)? Has it been defined or it is based on
the differing perceptions of People’s Liberation Army
(PLA) and the Indian Army or delineated on ground by
foreign ministries of both countries? Claude Arpi, an
authority on Sino-India-Tibet studies questions, “Where
is the Line that Zhou Enlai mentioned on 7 November
1959 to Nehru? Is there a map?” As per Claude Arpi, India entered into two major agreements with China,
Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the LAC
in September 1993 and Confidences Building Measures
in the Military Field along the LAC in November
1996. Ironically these agreements were signed without
attaching maps of the LAC. What is mutually agreed
line that will not be trespassed by the Indian Army and
PLA? It raises another important question what is to be
defended by the troops deployed on ground when LAC
is ambiguous? The predicament is that when it is left
to the good judgement of troops on ground, friction is
bound to take place.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> Brief Overview behind Friction Between PLA and the
Indian Army   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  The strategic objectives of both nations are
diagrammatically opposite; China may be endeavouring
to retain critical areas up to so called 1959 claim line
which is ambiguous and undefined on the ground.
Interestingly there are no maps that can indicate the
claim line of China at least of Western Sector known as
Eastern Ladakh. China was comfortable with “defensive
crouch” of India till General Sundarji adopted forward
posture post exercise Chequered board. This exercise
was conducted in the high altitude areas of Northeast
region in the midst of the Sumdorong Chu standoff. This
was a turning point and the Indian Army started taking
control of its territory along the LAC. Forward posture
transformed Indian Army from “defensive crouch” to
“defensive leap”. General Sundarji in spite of political
pressure to resolve the issue diplomatically refused to
bow down. General Sundarji had categorically told the
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi that he was not opposed
to the matter being settled diplomatically, but he was
firm that it is not 1962 and he would “teach the Chinese
side a lesson and a fitting reply if needed without even
thinking for a second”.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  India’s forward posture was a well thought out strategy
and it had three distinct phases. In phase one Indian
Army patrols started moving forward to dominate own
areas up to the LAC. Once dominance by patrolling
activity was established over own territory along
the LAC, in second phase defences were prepared in
close proximity to the LAC. In phase three push for
development of infrastructure took place to link critical
areas with communication arteries. The strategy to
dominate forward areas was viewed by China as a threat
to its control over 1959 ambiguous and floating claim
line. Development of communication and infrastructure
picked up pace only post 2000 that made China sit
up and take note of India’s assertion over their claim line. In all probability development of defences and
infrastructure made Chinese apprehensive of the intent
of the Indian Army. Without firing a shot, the Indian
Army in a systematic manner reclaimed own territory
post 1986-87 and that is seen by China as a threat
especially to Aksai Chin area in Eastern Ladakh.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  What Should be India’s Intent and Strategy?  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  India does not want to grab territory unlike China but
want firm control of own territory. While doing so, India
is keen to reduce friction points (without appeasement)
to avoid accidental war. In certain areas where China
is pushing hard, India want the damage to be minimal
and ground position to be restored to pre-April 2020
positions. In areas such as Depsang India will be fine if
it can patrol areas along RakiNala and patrolling points
10 to 13 as was being done hither to fore.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>   The issue is that war can be avoided only if you are war
ready. Preparation for war does not mean only building
forces and logistics but also building communication
and infrastructure adequate enough to apply force in
an acceptable time frame. Infrastructure development
along the Northern frontiers is imperative for speedy
deployment of forces to dissuade China from taking any
military adventurism. Agile and war ready forces can
act as recessed deterrence to prevent war.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  In addition, government needs to resolve the issue of
dual control of LAC. At present border management
is with Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and ITBP
is responsible for peace time border management on
ground. But when there is no peace and no war scenario,
there should be no ambiguity in command and control;
therefore, responsibility and accountability must rest
with one ministry and one organisation. During this
entire standoff in Eastern Ladakh, MHA and ITBP were
invisible and conspicuous by absence and thus raises
question what is MHA and ITBP doing in a disputed
border with little capabilities to influence ground
situation? It may be a good idea to place settled borders
with ITBP but it is detrimental to the national security
to let MHA handle unsettled borders with no expertise
or no capabilities to deal with the standoffs or ingress.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  China may be willing to reduce border tension by
proposing moratorium on patrolling and creation of
buffer zone to avoid standoffs between the opposing
forces. But this buffer zone should not be restricted
to Indian claim line only. Therefore, India must insist
either patrolling should be done up to the perceived
claim lines or moratorium on patrolling should be done
up to claim line of both countries. Similarly, buffer zone too should be between own and Chinese claim line.
That will force China to at least commit on ground
their perception of LAC. Moratorium on patrolling and
creation of buffer zone must be marked on map signed
by military commanders of both countries to avoid
misrepresentation of facts on ground by PLA and the
Indian Army.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> Conclusion   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> British Prime Minister Mr Chamberlain, after signing
a non-aggression treaty with Hitler in 1938, had said,
“I believe it is peace for our time.” A year later Hitler
invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland by throwing the
treaty to the dustbin. On the hind-side only gain British
Government had from this agreement was that British
military got some time to prepare for the war. India
must look at this disengagement as a pause for a long
haul and prepare for the hot summer ahead.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Claude Arpi said that, “MEA has often been the weak
‘diplomatic’ link.” He further says that, “The ‘original
sin’ of the present situation on the Indian border is
due to this particular weakness of MEA”. It is a good
sign that Modi Government is willing to correct the
past mistakes by not allowing South Block to adopt
soft and appeasement policy against China. Military
to military talks is a sign of no appeasement policy
and disengagement should take place on equal footing
without compromise. Most important issue is that India should not surrender any advantage during negotiations.
While military should be prepared for a long haul in the
summer but negotiations must focus to reduce friction
points. China is not in a hurry to retreat and may like to
witness Indian Army’s response in the coming summer
months. Thus in my assessment Indian Army will have
to stand firm in other areas as well.  </b></p>
