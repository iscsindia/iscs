                        </h2>

                        </ul>
                       
                        
                       <p class="excert"><b>  The India US relationship has been a subject of much
discussion and debate within the think tanks, study
groups, as well as inside the ivory towers and the
corridors of power in both Washington DC and New
Delhi. Virtually everyone who has an opinion knows
about what the other one wants. However, at the
common man’s level, there is always some concern and
amazement as to why, if everything is so obvious, they
don’t move as quickly and smoothly as expected.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Albert Einstein famously said “any intelligent fool
can complicate a simple problem. It takes courage to
move in the other direction”! Thus it begs the question
what exactly prevents the world's two most prominent
democracies from making a transformational shift in
their relationship instead of the reluctant, ‘one step
forward and two steps back’ dance they have been stuck
in for the past four decades. It may be vital to understand
what a prominent American once told me and I quote:
“we love you Indians as immigrants to this country. You
are professionals, hard working, have family values,
you look after your children well, are least problematic
from the law and order challenges, you are in the highest
median income and you ask for nothing”!! That’s the
image and perception of Indians in America. India
supplies one of the most productive economic group of
people; an extremely socially relevant peaceful group of
people in the US. With Indians, US is guaranteed no
law and order problem, white collar idiosyncrasies and
infringements aside.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Mr. Biden knows all about India and Indians even
though his flippant comment about the ‘7/11 Indians’ is
long forgotten but often recalled. His recent laudatory
statements about Indian Americans in his administration
prove that he is consciously aware of the accomplishments
of the Indian Americans and he sure believes they are
capable of delivering well for his administration. He has
brought in great quality of second generation Indians
in his administration. Whether it means anything
significant for India or for that matter anything at all,
one knows not. But one cannot ignore this important
recognition of Indians in America. President Biden is not
new to politics. However the world has changed around
him significantly including inside the Democratic Party
itself ever since he entered the portals of US Senate a
young man from Delaware.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  While the negotiations on various defence and related
geopolitical items, laced often with tough acronyms
continue, both leaderships must focus on issues and
items that can be expeditiously concluded. The key question is while the United States will focus on things
that they consider important from their point of view,
India must put forth its own conditions of satisfaction
that matters to them. The President spoke about the
‘rules based conduct’ in his telephone call with Prime
Minister Modi. That must be welcomed. However it
also must be made clear that those rules based conduct
cannot be unilateral in any single way. There must not
be one set of rules for Human Rights violations against
India while the bigger violators go scot free in the name
of ‘their cultural values’!  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> The Indian narrative must reflect a strategic shift from
an emotional narration of ‘vasudhiav kutumbkam’ to
a pragmatic logical stance and recognition that even
families live with their own set of conflicts! India is
indeed a 72 year young democracy but it has democratic values inbuilt in the Sanatan Dharm
principles of thousands of years of history and culture.
In reality India must lay its claim to being the mother and
genesis of democratic way of life. It’s not a propaganda
or any attempt towards proselytizing but speaking
the message in a legitimate way. India must educate
President Biden about its own ‘territorial imperatives’
specially when lectured about improving relationships
with a cantankerous neighbour who is mollycoddled by
the US for serving its bidding!   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> A constructive alternative needs to have a clear
understanding of the root causes of their common
purposes. US must acknowledge that any effort to
weaken a powerful democratic India in the the Indo
Pacific region will have a direct consequence to its
own cherished values of life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness. US cannot thrive by weakening or destroying
the democracies that are friends. While India continues
to deal with the enemy within, US must not allow
those who weaken democratic practices, to subvert
democratic principles in the name of democracy itself!
Both countries must demand RECIPROCITY, in every
sense of the term, from those who push their own vested
narratives to exploit freedoms in the name of freedoms
itself!   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  India must wholeheartedly reject the “new norms” of
American egalitarianism, its current cultural export
of wokism, cancel culture and negationism! India is
a country that has upheld differences and diversity
of languages and people in the way we live, eat and
pray. The universal purpose must outlive any current
disposition, driven by frustration and unhappiness of
people, and be accepted around the world and that
narrative must be set by India.
The United States is struggling with its own internal
and international challenges to its reputation where
the brand US has taken a big hit. Like the post Second
World War interpretation, the post corona virus world
will need to come to terms with the new realities of lives
completely destroyed. USA has suffered a sad end to
over 500,000 lives in ‘peace time’ and its handling of
the crisis remains a matter of intense debate. India has
indeed emerged as country that showed the world how
deftly the crisis was managed including manufacturing
of vaccines and distribution across the world. India has
earned rightful gratitude and appreciation from global
leaderships across the board, USA is only now appearing
to be in control despite intense bickerings across party
lines.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  The United States is currently unable to meet the real
challenge of ‘affluence and plenty’ and ‘continuity or
change’. US is almost three times larger than India,
has one fourth of India’s population, is very resource
rich and with a very reasonable infrastructure in place
to remain an economic power house in the world.
Whether it remains at the number one spot is a matter
of speculation and debate. To remain the primary
power of the economic giant, US needs India as never
before, given the general mistrust American have
regarding China and its communist ideology and lack of
transparency in almost every sphere of the political and
economic behavior as pointed out in a recent survey.
This is where India must step in to not only fill the void
left by China’s belligerent conducts but offer an efficient
and effective solution to American businesses to
capture the opportunity created by the global pandemic
that originated in the Wuhan laboratory in China.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  The Democratic party’s current romance with socialism
is a direct outcome of its affluence and prosperity
experienced, strangely enough, under a capitalist system!
The classical socialist tool of “redistribution of income”
has caught the imagination of the politicians who seek
to capture the ‘one man one vote’ by promising people
gifts and support as is done by political elites in socialist
countries. India is moving away from socialism evidenced
from Prime Minister’s recent call to accord respect and
responsibility to the private sector to become leaders of
business including the fact that “the government has no
business to be in business”! Both leaders must convene
a summit to address two specific issues: 1. How can
US offer its experience and expertise of private sector
participation in the economic revival / surge to India
achieving its rightful place in the global economic high
table and 2. What must both countries do to remove the irritants to achieve enhanced collaboration and
cooperation towards a trustworthy relationship.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  A few immediate steps needed relate to 1) beware of
political and/or bureaucratic complacency and in
attention to each other’s needs and compulsions. Mr.
Biden’s party must ensure that local chieftains in the US
do not interfere in affairs of India’s internal domestic
compulsions just as Indian city municipalities do not
pass inane, idiotic resolutions on racial injustices in
America! 2) ignore and stump the belligerent behavior
of the desperate beleaguered nations who only claim
legitimacy by manipulating “democratic principles”
3) recognition of the strategic realities supporting
transactional elements to benefit each other’s long term
goals. 4) become risk intelligent to grasp the reality that
there is a price to pay for not doing anything or letting
things drift away.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  The China conundrum is important for both India and
the US. The two most prominent democracies that the
world looks up to with hopes and aspirations cannot
allow themselves to be bullied by the communist
ideology and its manipulation / violation of democratic
rules and codes of conduct. Neither country can allow
“their cultural values” to override our cultural values!
There is enough convergence between the two countries.
Let’s cultivate them instead of aggravating relationships
with divergences.  </b></p>
