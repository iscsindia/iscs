                       <p class="excert"><b> Bengal is at a course-altering doorstep of history.
After nearly six decades of stagnation, unemployment,
man-made famines and food shortages, violent
activism, Maoism, Communist repression, crippling
trade unionism, vanishing of innovation and industry,
cultural morass, massive illegal migration, rise of
Islamism, corruption, nepotism and brazen political
massacres, the state stands at the door of hope with the
key to revival in its hand. By unlocking it, it can unlock
its potential to be not just the nation’s brightest star, but
also the fulcrum of India’s Look East policy.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> How can Bengal show itself the way and lead the rest
of the nation again with thoughts, ideas and action? It
needs to have an ambitious vision and work persistently,
relentlessly towards that goal.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  It is time the state starts working on a SWAG
model. While we spell out the acronym below, the
transformation will require the qualities associated
with the word ‘swag’ that youngsters commonly use:
A winning attitude, unshakable confidence, and quiet
determination.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  In Bengal’s context, here is SWAG for you:  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Secure Borders and Bylanes   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Work Culture, Industry, Innovation, Enterprise  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Art and Culture Hub  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Gateway to the East  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Now, let us see elaborate on each of the four core ideas,
with practical steps for action and implementation.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Secure Borders and Bylanes:  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>   Bengal has seen the bloodiest Partition and post-
Partition violence. From Noakhali riots to Direct Action
Day to the killing of 3 million Bengalis and rape of 6
million women by the Pakistan Army and its militias,
it has been a long era of darkness. Violent Naxalism
added to it. Sainbari, Marichjhhapi and Ananda Margi
massacres, Nandigram slaughter, and 10 years of killing
political opponents under Mamata Banerjee testify to
India’s arguably most violent polity. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>   Through continuous infiltration from Bangladesh,
the population of Hindus in the state has dropped by 8% and that of Muslims increased by over 12% at last
count. The border is still highly compromised, with
smuggling of cattle, human trafficking and entry of
terrorist elements happening freely at many points. </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  To make Bengal secure from external and internal
threats, some steps are urgently needed:  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • NRC: National Register of Citizens is most
needed in Bengal to identify, detain and deport
illegals.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • CAA: Hindus who have arrived because of
atrocities in Muslim-dominated Bangladesh
should be settled under the Citizenship
Amendment Act.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Watertight border: The entire border needs to be
fenced and manned by high-end surveillance
drones and other equipment with no tolerance
towards infiltrators.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Re-Hinduise the border: The international
border, both by circumstances and design,
has been de-Hinduised. There is an urgent need
to re-Hinduise the border, especially vulnerable
places like the Chicken’s Neck, but settling
troop families and those naturalised under CAA
and other citizenship laws.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Closer ties with Bangladesh, Myanmar: A
stronger mechanism to send back illegals
Bangladeshis and Rohingyas and better counterterrorism
efforts (handing over their terrorists
hiding in India, for instance).  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Overhaul of police force: For political reasons,
the police have been packed with elements
inimical to the state and the nation. Need to
weed out those elements.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Elimination of criminals: To rid the polity
of criminals, a district wise list needs to be drawn,
a coordination cell set up, and these criminals
must be systematically arrested or neutralised.
Those with unpunished crimes must pay.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Women’s safety: Flying units to be set up to
stop sexual harassment on streets, forcible
conversions and sexual violence.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Breaking syndicates: From construction,
fisheries, flower trade, filmdom to health and
hospitality, visible action to break down the
cartels is needed.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Ban cow slaughter and cattle smuggling.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Work Culture, Industry, Innovation, Enterprise:
To bring back industry and innovation to Bengal,
the focus will have to be back on the individual. For
far long people have been given the worst governance,
denied basic health and welfare schemes, told that they
can only aspire to serve others as employees, that too
largely outside Bengal. They have seen industry after
industry shut down, driven away or driven to dust by
hostile trade unions. So much so that most Bengali
youngsters are even scared to dream that they can create
a startup that will be valued at billions some day and
employ thousands. The confidence has to be brought
back.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Here are some steps which could transform the state:  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Improve human indices: Bring the benefits of
every central scheme like Ayushman Bharat to the
state. Bengal also has the fewest tap water
connections, for instance.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Special Knowledge Zones: With Bengal’s
staggering intellectual capital, it can be the
powerhouse for electronic, biomedical, genetics
and other patent-oriented research. There
should be a concerted effort to set up top-class
universities and bring in capital for state-ofthe-
art research labs. Draft and implement a
policy just to create these knowledge zones.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Heavy industries belt: The state should create a
thriving heavy industries belt from Durgapur
to Kalyani, which will then spawn ancillary
industries.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Creative startup hubs: Places like Siliguri or
outskirts of Kolkata can see bustling startup
zones especially in the creative fields like films,
ads, video, audio, design, art, music, newage
furniture and food. Offer big tax incentives,
cheap spaces to attract talent and investment.
There is tremendous potential to develop virtual
reality and artificial intelligence hubs in the
state.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Jute revival: Bengal’s once-roaring jute mills
can be revived in Hooghly. But more importantly,
jute studios that produce eco-friendly and
attractive rugs, wall art, mat, stools etc could be
set up.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Bengal’s own biz heroes: The state needs its
own Narayana Murthys and Azim Premjis.
Contrary to the perception that Bengalis do not
make great entrepreneurs, Bengal has seen titans like Dwarakanath Tagore, Ramdulal Sarkar,
Amarendu Bose, Purnendu Chatterjee. At least
one or two Bengali entrepreneurs should be
encouraged to set up mega, modern units for the
younger generation to follow. Give special
incentives to units that employ more than 1,000
people.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Break the unions: Bring stricter norms against
trade unionism. Also, work covertly to take out
the criminal elements in the trade unions.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Pond, river and sea resource: There is massive
potential in fisheries and related products.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • The good earth: Bengal is blessed with
extremely fertile alluvial soil. Fruits and
vegetables are very flavourful here. It is time to
set up cooperatives and develop organic
farming, branding Bengal’s produce uniquely.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> Art, Culture and Tourism Hub:
Bengal has led India in art and culture, but in the last
few decades, it rested on past glory and produced its best
only erratically, not in a sustained, marketable way. Years
of communism and minority votebank appeasement
has stopped Bengal from properly showcasing its rich
spiritual traditions and culture.
It is also a state incredibly gifted by nature. From
Sundarbans to Darjeeling, from charming riversides to
a breathtaking coastline, it is a tourist’s delight.
Here are some steps that can help the state unleash its
superpowers in art, culture and tourism.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • One District One Art: Like Uttar Pradesh’s One
District One Product, Bengal should identify,
develop and link to national and international
markets. Silk from Murshidabad, patachitra
of Purulia, terracotta art of Bankura, kantha
stitch of Birbhum could all be labour- and talentintensive
industries branding and selling their
ware worldwide. There are many local theatre
and dance forms that must be similarly
promoted.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Mishti Bangla: In a state famous for its sweets,
certain places are known for their specialities.
Sweet hubs can be set up around Kolkata’s
roshogolla and mishtidoi, Burdwan’s langcha
and mihidana, Krishnanagar’s sharbhaja,
Joynagar’s moa, Murshidabad’s kheermohan,
Coochbehar’s jalebi or jilipi. These can be
marketed nationally and internationally.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Art districts: Entire art districts can be set up
along the Ganges in Kolkata or Darjeeling/
Kalimpong where young and established artists
across Bengal, India and the world can put
up their work, along with music, wine or teatasting
sessions. Shut industrial units along
Kolkata’s riverfront can be artistically renovated
fusing Bauhaus and local styles to create unique
artistic spaces.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Artistes’ colonies: Bengal should introduce
subsidised, low-cost but aesthetically built
housing for its artistes. It will go a long way in
encouraging talent.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Heritage district: Parts of old north Kolkata,
with its palaces and amazing architecture, to
undergo heritage conservation and revival.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Spiritual tourism: The state should build a
Shakti Circuit smoothly connecting Kalighat,
Dakshineshwar, Belur Matth, Tarapith,
Tarakeshwar, Ramkrishna Paramhans’s birth
place Kamarpukur and other such sites. It
must also build a Bhakti Circuit connecting
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’sbirthplace Nabadwip,
Iskcon and Vedic temple at Mayapur, terracotta
temples and ‘gupt Vrindavan’ of Bishnupur,
Radha Krishna Mandir and Mira Mandir in
Kolkata.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Writers’ Trail: Create tourist trail touching
upon Bishop Lefroy Road in south Kolkata
where Satyajit Ray lived for 22 years to
Tagore’s abode in Shantiniketan, from
Saratchandra Chattopadhyay’s house
SaratKuthi in Samta village to Coffee House or
a country liquor bar in Khalashitola where
the famous authors would congregate for
coffee or to get drunk on cheap liquor. All
these places can be renovated, made into small
museums selling the writers’ works and
mementos.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Forest and sea: Bengal’s forest and sea tourism
needs to take a leap with better hotels,
adventure activities and access. Helicopter
tours over Sundarbans and deep forest stays,
elephant trails in Dooars, or trips around
shooting locales in Purulia’s forests where Ray,
Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen shot their movies are just some ideas.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Bankim Museum of Nationalism: India’s
biggest and most splendid museum of nationalism
should be built in Bengal and named after Bankim
Chandra Chattopadhyay, the writer of VandeMataram.
The modern, high-tech museum will tell the story
of India’s glorious past, its heroes and patriots, its
national movements through giant-screen video
presentations, light-and-sound shows, artifacts,
listening posts, a well-stocked library, regular talks and
symposiums.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> Gateway to the East:   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  If Bengal regains its economic and cultural might, it
would trigger development in the entire region. It could
also become India’s gateway to the East. Transport and
communication can not only be strengthened with the
neighbouring and nearby states including the Northeast,
but lines of trade and communication can be opened
to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, Cambodia,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia right up to China, Korea
and Japan. With vision and unwavering commitment
to development, Kolkata can in 10-20 years become a
world city as influential as Singapore or Hong Kong.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  Here are some measures which will help Bengal open
up communication, access, transport and trade:  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Access to Northeast: Siliguri should be developed
as a full-fledged trade and transit hub for Northeast,
Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and China.
A bigger airport, more roads and rail links need to be built from Siliguri to all these places. The city
must also be developed as a knowledge hub,
tapping into the immense talent from the Hills and
north Bengal.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> • Direct flights: Many more direct flights from Bengal
to not just rest of the region but to South East Asia,
Middle East and Australia-New Zealand are
needed.   </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Road to the East: As an answer to China’s OBOR,
India should start building a Highway Of Rising
Sun (HORS). It will start from Kolkata and wind
through friendly countries, connecting as much of
south-east Asia as possible.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • Port of call: Besides developing Haldia into a
widely connected shallow water port, the Sagar
port must emerge as a strong navy port ready to
meet any challenge from the eastern front.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • More airports: The state needs development and
expansion of three or four more major airports.
The Kazi Nazrul Islam airport should be expanded
to serve the Durgapur industrial belt better.
Balurghat, Malda and Coochbehar airports should
be expanded to serve the region better.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b>  • South-North connectivity: A dedicated Kolkata-
Siliguri Expressway should be built to cut travel
time by more than half.  </b></p>
					   <p class="excert"><b> For most parts, this is a plan for the next 5 to 10
years. Through meticulous planning and dedicated  </b></p>
